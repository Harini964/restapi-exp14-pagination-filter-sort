This screenshot shows the output of Experiment 14 — a web-based application built using only JavaScript. It demonstrates dynamic:

- 🔍 Filtering (by product name)
- 🔃 Sorting (by name or price, ascending/descending)
- 📄 Pagination (custom page size and navigation buttons)

The UI allows users to interact with a product list in real-time, adjusting how data is displayed based on user input. This example requires no external libraries or frameworks.
